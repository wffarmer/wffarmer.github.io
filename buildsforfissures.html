                    The quickest <a href="fissures.html">Void Fissures</a> in Warframe are all exterminate or capture missions, where you will also  have to kill some corrupted enemies to collect reactant to complete the void fissure. <br><br> This is why the best Warframe builds for these quick void fissures must be able to move fast and kill many enemies fast. I would say that the best Warframes for that are Gauss for higher level missions, and Titania with Gauss' helminth ability injected into her, for lower level missions. <br><br> You can also use Gauss for lower level missions, I just prefer to use Titania because of her flight. In addition, I'd recommend you to use a Smeeta Kavat when doing normal void fissures. The most important mods are Fetch and Charm. <br><br> Smeeta Kavat build<br><img src="/images/smeeta.png"> <br><br> In both Warframe builds, we utilize the power of thermal sunder (Gauss’ third ability), and the speed of the Warframe. In game, go to settings > invert tap/hold abilities, and change Gauss to inverted, because we are only going to use thermal sunder’s heat mode. <br><br> When thermal sunder in heat mode is used, it deals damage to enemies around the Warframe, and applies a heat status effect proc. In addition, each subsequent heat proc from thermal sunder deals twice the damage of the previous one. <br><br> Using this ability alone as your damage tool, you can kill several low level enemies with one cast, and you can complete a low level exterminate mission in about one minute or less, solo. <br><br> Higher level fissures might take slightly longer, while steel path fissures take about 40 seconds longer due to the enemies' sheer effective hitpoints. <br><br> Here are the Warframe builds; Note that these builds have some mods and arcanes which are easiest to get by just buying them with platinum, which you will need to <a href="plat.html">farm</a> or buy. by the way, you don't need to keep up roar active the entire time, just when you need more damage.<br><br> Gauss build <br> <img src="/images/gauss1.png"> <br><br> High ability range is a must when using thermal sunder as a nuke, so put in Overextended and Stretch. We will also need a lot of energy to spam thermal sunder and use mach rush, so put in Preparation, Primed Flow and maxed Fleeting Expertise. <br><br> Speaking of mach rush, equip Sprint Boost and Rush to spend less time covering X distance thanks to the faster sprint speed. <br><br> Umbral Intensify will partially compensate for the Ability Strength reduction from Overextended, use normal intensify instead if it makes more sense in your situation. <br><br> Natural Talent makes you able to cast thermal sunder more times in the same amount of time, and Archon Vitality makes it so that each cast applies 2 heat procs, increasing the damage. Molt Augmented increases your ability strength as you kill enemies, it's especially useful when you need to kill a lot of enemies in a single mission. <br><br> For Arcane Energize, if you can't afford a maxed one, keep in mind that you may buy just 3 of it, and fuse them into a <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Arcane_Enhancement#Rank">Rank 1 Arcane</a>; for 1/7 the cost of the maxed Arcane getting 1/3 of the effect. or buy 6, Fuse them into a Rank 2 arcane, and for 2/7 of the price get 50% of the effect. You get the idea. <br><br> For Steel Path, I recommend these changes: replace the aura mod with Corrosive Projection to make enemies easier to kill, and replace the maxed Fleeting Expertise + Rush with Rank 4 Fleeting Expertise + Rank 4 Streamline, which will give you exactly 175% Ability Efficiency. Also, replace Molt Augmented with Arcane Steadfast. <br><br> Steel Path Gauss build<img src="/images/gauss2.png"> <br><br> When doing Steel Path fissures with this build, I STRONGLY recommend you to also use several amber <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Archon_Shard">Archon Shards</a> for even more casting speed (aim for extra +100%), and an <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/On_Call_Crew">On Call Crew</a> member equipped with a well modded Kuva Zarr to help you clear enemies faster. Also, keep roar active. <br><br> I would also recommend using Panzer Vulpaphyla instead of Smeeta Kavat in the Steel Path. <br><br> Panzer Vulpaphyla build<br><img src="/images/panzer.png"> <br><br> Now, Titania. Titania is a notorious Warframe because she can fly very fast. And if you inject her with Gauss' thermal sunder, you can complete Void Fissures in record time. Here's the build: <br><br> Titania build<br><img src="/images/titania1.png"> <br><br> This build is basically the same as the first Gauss build, just with Enemy Radar in the aura mod slot, and Razorwing Blitz instead of Rush. <br><br> Use Unairu focus school with maxed <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Focus/Unairu#Poise">Poise</a> to stop getting staggered when colliding with walls. To activate it with the least disturbance to your gameplay, while being in Titania's flight mode, use transference, then melee, then switch weapon (on PC, by default, 5 + E + F). Alternatively, you can just use transference twice (5 + 5); This is slower, but mechanically simpler.<br><br> Dex Pixia build<br><img src="/images/dexpixia.png"> <br><br> For Titania's guns, I recommend to use these mods, which result in the combination of corrosive + radiation + heat, Titania's guns with these mods will shred basically any enemy you will face in a normal void fissure. <br><br> With these builds, you can complete any fast void fissure in record time, but you need to be patient both when farming to get these builds if you can't make them right now, and when getting used to controlling the Warframe's movement if you're not used to it. <br><br> Good luck!
