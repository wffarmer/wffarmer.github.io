                The best way to farm Warframe platinum for free to play beginners is by farming and selling prime parts, which you can get from Void Relics. In this guide, I'll show you how to do it step-by-step. <br><br> <span class="subheading"> Step 1: Farming LITH Void Relics </span> <br> First, we will need some Void Relics to crack. Lith relics are the easiest to get, we will be farming them using two methods. <br><br> &#x2022; <strong>Method 1: </strong>running hepit in Void on repeat. You unlock hepit by unlocking Mars, then Phobos, then Void, in the star chart. <br><br> &#x2022; <strong>Method 2: </strong> asking players in trade chat to give us some lith relics for free. The message you should send for this is something like <br><br> "can someone give me some lith relics please?" <br><br> Remember that receiving Void Relics in a trade costs credits. Make sure to have 2,000 credits for every Void Relic you are going to receive. <br><br> These are the two most effective methods to farm lith Void Relics as a beginner. You can even do both at the same time, sending a message between hepit runs.<br><br> <span class="subheading"> Step 2: Cracking the Void Relics </span> <br> You will need to complete Void Fissures to crack Void Relics. Warframe.school has a <a href="fissures.html">separate page about Void Fissures</a>. You will need to spam a lot of Void Fissures to get many prime parts, which you will later sell. <br><br> The following is not always true, but it is true in the vast majority of cases: at the end of a Void Fissure, you should pick the drop with the highest ducat value. You can hover over each prime part to check the ducat value. There are exceptions though, you will learn over time as well. <br><br> <span class="subheading"> Step 3: Sell the prime parts </span><br> This is a very important step where a lot of players mess up. First, it’s important to know the value of your prime parts. For that, I recommend <a href="https://warframe.market/">Warframe.market</a>, a website which will show you buy and sell listings made by Warframe players, which will show you the actual price of any tradeable item. <br><br> I recommend you to sign up on Warframe.market, and if you have any prime parts which cost significantly more than prime junk, sell them there, instead of as prime junk in trade chat. <br><br> For every single prime part you don’t know the value of, search it on Warframe.market, and memorize it. Generally, most of the prime parts you will get from Void Fissures will be "Prime Junk", but some might be worth more than Prime Junk. <br><br> Next, the price of prime junk is 1 platinum per 10-15 ducats. I recommend selling your prime junk at closer to 10 ducats per platinum, which is 45 ducat items for 4 platinum, and 100 ducat items for 10 platinum, while keeping the 15/25 ducat items for yourself. <br><br> You should only be selling your prime junk if you have at least 6 items which you want to sell, ideally much more than 6. With prime junk, players usually go for full trades only, which means 6 items per trade. <br><br> Keep in mind that in the Warframe trade chat, players very often try to buy things for way cheaper than their actual price. Don’t fall for it and be patient when selling prime junk. <br><br> To sell your prime junk, keep sending something like this to trade chat, I even recommend writing it in a notepad file, copying it, and just pasting it into trade chat, instead of writing manually every time: <br><br> "WTS Prime Junk 100:ducats: = 10:platinum: | 45:ducats: = 4:platinum:" <br><br> Just keep spamming your message into trade chat, and if you do it long enough, ducat buyers will come. Remember that receiving platinum in a trade costs credits. Make sure to have 500 credits for every platinum you are going to receive. <br><br> You can get 75 platinum per hour doing this (excluding the time it takes to acquire the relics), and there are even better ways to farm platinum which you can’t do effectively as a beginner due to many reasons. <br><br> Good luck farming!
