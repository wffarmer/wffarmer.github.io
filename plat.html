                The best way to farm Warframe platinum for free to play beginners is by farming and selling prime parts, which you can get from Void Relics. In this guide, I'll show you how to do it step-by-step. <br><br> <span class="subheading"> Step 1: Farming LITH Void Relics </span> <br> First, we will need some Void Relics to crack. Lith relics are the easiest to get, we will be farming them using two methods. <br><br> &#x2022; <strong>Method 1: </strong>running hepit in Void on repeat. You unlock hepit by unlocking Mars, then Phobos, then Void, in the star chart. You can get roughly 40 relics per hour doing this with an unmodded starter Warframe and a decently modded melee weapon.<br><br> &#x2022; <strong>Method 2: </strong> asking players in trade chat to give us some lith relics for free (for best results, choose NA/EU region in settings). The message you should send for this is something like <br><br> "can someone give me some lith relics please?"<br><img src="/images/can.png" class="sixty"><br> Remember that receiving Void Relics in a trade costs credits. Make sure to have 2,000 credits for every Void Relic you are going to receive. You can get up to 6 x (your mastery rank) relics per day with this method, but you're not entitled to anything. <br><br> You may get irrelevant or slightly mean replies, just close their chat tab, and repeat this until someone invites you or responds with something like "yes". Some players are ready to give you some lith relics because they have more than they will ever use themselves, or because they want to help you. I think it's a waste not to use this fact. <br><img src="/images/dongo.png" class="seventy"><br>You may even get a whole Revenant Prime set or something similar as a gift from some high mastery rank player who simply felt like giving it, that's the kind of game Warframe is. Although, once again, you are not entitled to receiving anything from anyone, and don't ask for too much. <br><img src="/images/freerev.png" class="seventy"><br>These are the two most effective methods to farm lith Void Relics as a beginner. You can even do both at the same time, sending a message between hepit runs.<br><br> <span class="subheading"> Step 2: Cracking the Void Relics </span> <br> You will need to complete Void Fissures to crack Void Relics. Warframe.school has a separate page about <a href="fissures.html">Void Fissures</a>. You will need to spam a lot of Void Fissures to get many prime parts, which you will later sell. You should be in public mode to get more drops to choose from in the end of a fissure (for best results, choose NA/EU region in settings). <br><br> Now, because you will need to spam a lot of Void Fissures, I recommend you to ONLY do the fastest lith fissures that exist, to waste less time. These are "Mariana" and "E Prime". Yes, I actually recommend you to NOT do any other lith void fissures as a beginner, and just do something else if these fissures are not currently active. <br><br> You can track active fissures on <a href="https://hub.warframestat.us">hub.warframestat.us</a>, even when you're not online. <br><img src="/images/hub.png" class="seventy"><br> It's very common for beginners to waste a lot of time doing slow fissures, which are a bad mission type or tileset, and getting much fewer drops than they could have, over time, if they had done only the best void fissures.<br><br> The following is not always true, but it is true in the vast majority of cases: at the end of a Void Fissure, you should pick the drop with the highest ducat value. You can hover over each prime part to check the ducat value. There are exceptions though, as you will learn over time. <br><br> Items which can be exchanged for ducats (AKA prime parts), can also be sold to other players for platinum, after which, these players will exchange the prime parts for ducats. this is why we usually pick the prime part that's worth the most ducats. <br><br> The prime parts you are farming actually hold more value if you just exchange them for ducats directly, instead of selling to other players for platinum as prime junk, but only in the long term, as in months/years. if you need platinum within hours/days/weeks, just follow this guide. <br><br> <span class="subheading"> Step 3: Sell the prime parts </span><br> This is a very important step where a lot of players mess up. First, it’s important to know the value of your prime parts. For that, I recommend <a href="https://warframe.market/">Warframe.market</a>, a website which will show you buy and sell listings made by Warframe players, which will show you the actual price of any tradeable item. <br><img src="/images/ashset.png" class="s5"> <br> For every single prime part you don’t know the value of, search it on Warframe.market, and memorize it. Generally, most of the prime parts you will get from Void Fissures will be "Prime Junk", but some might be worth more than Prime Junk. <br><br> Next, the price of prime junk is 10-15 ducats for 1 platinum. I recommend selling your prime junk at closer to 10 ducats per platinum, which is 45 ducat items for 4 platinum, and 100 ducat items for 10 platinum, while keeping the 15/25 ducat items for yourself. <br><img src="/images/junk288.png" class="sixty"><img src="/images/junk373.png" class="sixty"><br> I recommend you to sign up on Warframe.market, and if you have any prime parts which cost significantly more than prime junk, sell them there, instead of as prime junk in trade chat. <br><img src="/images/goodprimes.png" class="seventy"><br> You should only be selling your prime junk if you have at least 6 items which you want to sell, ideally much more than 6. With prime junk, players usually go for full trades only, which means 6 items per trade. <br><br> Keep in mind that in the Warframe trade chat, players very often try to buy things for way cheaper than their actual price. Don’t fall for it and be patient when selling prime junk. <br><br> To sell your prime junk, open trade chat(for best results, choose NA/EU region in settings), select the filters as shown below: <br><img src="/images/filters.png" class="fifty"> <br> and keep sending keep sending something like this to trade chat, I even recommend writing it in a notepad file, copying it, and just pasting it into trade chat, instead of writing manually every time: <br><br> "WTS Prime Junk 100:ducats: = 10:platinum: | 45:ducats: = 4:platinum:"<br><img src="/images/wts.png" class="eighty"> <br>Just keep spamming your message into trade chat, keep the trade chat open, and if you do it for long enough, ducat buyers will appear. <br><br> The amount of time it will take to find a prime junk buyer heavily depends on the region, the time of the day, and your luck, but two ways to significantly reduce this time are to try to sell your prime junk when the <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Baro_Ki%27Teer"> Void Trader</a> is around, or sell to someone that has already bought prime junk from you (you can add them as a friend).  <br><br> Remember that receiving platinum in a trade costs credits. Make sure to have 500 credits for every platinum you are going to receive. <br><br> You can get roughly 75 platinum per hour doing this (excluding the time it takes to acquire the relics and sell your prime parts). <br><br> Keep in mind that increasing your mastery rank also increases the amount of times you can trade every day, so if you're serious about farming platinum, I recommend also focusing on acquiring and maxing equipment, mostly weapons and Warframes - normal and prime. This alone will get you to at the very least MR 27; with time, of course. <br><br> Good luck!
