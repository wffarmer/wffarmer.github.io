                    Warframe has several types of resources. The most important resources in Warframe are:<br><br>Credits: Warframe's standard currency. Used for a lot of things. Affected by CREDIT booster.<br>Platinum: Warframe's premium currency. Used for buying items from the in game Market, and Trading with other players for their tradeable items. <br>Endo: Used for upgrading Mods.<br>Ducats: Used for buying items from the Void Trader NPC (named Baro Ki'teer).<br><br>All of the resources below are affected by Resource Booster, except for a few special ones (at the bottom of this page).<br><br>Star Chart Resources: Resources you can get from star chart missions - either from enemies, resource containers or special activities.<br><br>Open World Resources: Resources you can get only from open worlds - either from special activities, open world NPCs, resource containers or enemies.<br><br>Empyrean Resources: Resources you can get from Railjack missions - either from enemies, resource containers or end of mission bonus rewards.<br><br><b>Important</b>:
                    if the resource you are farming is affected by Resource Booster, use a Resource Booster and a Smeeta Kavat with the mod "Charm" when farming it. It will save you a lot of time, especially if you need a lot of that resource.<br><br>You can buy Boosters in the in game market for Platinum, in your orbiter. <br><br> Players which are Mastery Rank 30 or higher can also use blessings, which can further increase resource drop chance or the amount of credits gained by 25%. Blessings give this buff to all players within a relay, so anyone can benefit from a blessing. <br><br>Finally, when playing in The Steel Path mode, you will have +100% resource drop chance and +100% mod drop chance. An increase in mod drop chance means higher chance for Endo, Mod and Arcane drops FROM ENEMIES (excluding bosses). In addition, in The Steel Path, some Open World resource containers will drop more resources, and bounties will give higher rewards, but the enemies will be much stronger.<br><br> <b>Read More</b>: <span class="mw"><a href="power.html">How to get strong</a></span><br><br>Here is the list of resources/pickups/rewards NOT affected by Resource Booster: <br><br>Animo Nav Beacon, Aya(all types), Ayatan sculptures and stars, Blueprint(all types), Corrupted Holokey, Credits, Crystal Fragments(all types), Ducats, Endo, Granum Crown(all types), Invasion rewards, Judgement Points, Kullervo's Bane, Orokin Cipher, Pathos Clamp, Platinum, Sentient Core(all types), Syndicate Medallions(all types), Weapon parts.
