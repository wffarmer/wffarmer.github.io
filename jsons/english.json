  "pagetextpower": "Being strong in Warframe requires two things - proper Equipment and proper Mods on the Equipment. There are several extra upgrades that make you even stronger and/or improve QOL such as Arcanes, Helminth, Archon Shards, etc. , but first - Equipment and Mods: <br><br> Equipment is what you equip in your arsenal - Warframes, Weapons, Companions, Gear Wheel items, etc.<br><br>Using Mods, you can upgrade any Equipment that Warframe allows you to put Mods on, such as Weapons, Warframes, Companions, Archwings, etc.<br><br><b>Read More</b>: <a href=\"modding.html\">Modding</a>, <a href=\"metabuilds.html\">Meta Builds</a>, <a href=\"cheapbuilds.html\">Cheap Builds</a><br><br>Next up - Arcanes, Helminth, Archon Shards:<br><br>Arcanes are strong upgrades that you can put on all Warframes and most Weapons.<br><br>The Helminth System allows you to sacrifice non-prime Warframes to be able to attach a specific ability from their kit (chosen by the developers of Warframe) to any Warframe instead of one of their own abilities (with some restrictions). It also requires large amounts of various resources to do that.<br><br>Archon Shards are upgrades which you can pick what buff they give. Each shard gives a different selection of buffs to choose from, based on its color. You can attach up to 5 Archon Shards to each Warframe, and you can detach them. You must have the Helminth Segment to use Archon Shards.<br><br><b>Read More</b>: <a href=\"resources.html\">how to farm resources</a>",
