                    In Warframe, you start with just a Warframe, a primary, a secondary and a melee weapon, 50 platinum which you can't use for trading, some credits and a few basic mods. But more importantly, if you have just started playing Warframe for the first time, you most likely have no idea how the game works, what to do at some points in time, and how to make progress.<br><br>Here is what the classic Warframe journey looks like:<br><br>After finishing the tutorial, you will see your orbiter and the star chart, which can be accessed from the navigation in the orbiter.<br><br> The orbiter is your spaceship where you appear when you log into the game, from which you will usually have to use the navigation to access any mission which you might want to do, except for some special missions, like some quest missions.<br><br>At this point, you should start completing all the missions in the star chart and all the quests which are necessary to unlock junctions - a duel with an NPC which you have to win to unlock the next planet from the current planet.<br><br>Don't forget to upgrade your equipment to keep the progress smooth, and remember a few pointers:<br><br>What the endgame in Warframe is, is different for different people, depending on what they choose. Some of the common choices are: unlocking and maxing various equipment, which will get you mastery points. Learning about the many topics in Warframe and trying different activities out. Making platinum through trading. Trying out different builds. Warframe content creation. Usually, it's a combination of some or all of these things, and maybe something else, too.
